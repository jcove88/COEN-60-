			<h3>Travel</h3>
			<p>I have a passion for travel and exploring new places. My favorite trip that I have been on was when I wen t to Eastern Europe with my friends during my senior year in high school. We visted Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, and also stopped in Germany for a day. This was a great trip and you can find the link to the program associated with the touring below.</p>
